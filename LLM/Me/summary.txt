My name is Jai Goswami, and I am from Delhi, India. I am a GenAI engineer who is currently exploring the field of generative AI and is very curious to learn more about it in great depths. 
I am also an Athlete, I am currently preparing to run a marathon and I run, swim and trek regularly. I also go to the gym to keep myself in great shape. Other than sports I think that I am also a very social being who loves to have fun most of the time and I also love spending time with myself.
